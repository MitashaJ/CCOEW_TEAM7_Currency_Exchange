NTRS APAC summer internship hackathon

This is TEAM-7 entry for the APAC Northern Trust Tech Hackathon from Cummins College of Engineering for Women, Pune.


## Problem Statement

Create a dashboard which will allow users to analyze the exchange rates between two currencies
over a period of time. Users should have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly
charts. The dashboard should also display the date on which the rate was at its peak (highest) and
the date on which it was at its lowest. Users should be able to print the data in a chart. Input will be
currency exchange rate dataset between a currency pair and will be provided in a file format
Use USD as Base Currency where first currency will always be USD and second currency will be
variable. For instance, currency pairs could be USD/INR, USD/GBP, USD/EUR, USD/CAD etc.

A feature that provides FX rates for a chosen currency while taking a chosen currency into account.

User interface (UI) that is user friendly and fluid for all types of users. However, a user can see the exchange rate at a specific point in the graph.

## User Interface Essentials
UI should have the option to select 2 currencies (Currency 1 and Currency 2). Currency 1 auto populate with USD. Users should have the search capability to search for a currency in currency 2 field. Display currency name next to currency field.

Users should have an option to select duration for which they would prefer to see the data and graphs.
